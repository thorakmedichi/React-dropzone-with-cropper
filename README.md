## React Dropzone with Cropper

I started messing around with this while working on a personal project. The idea was to have a self contained React component I could throw onto any site that had the functionality of dropzone but also an image cropper to manipulate images for a travel blog.

While I may still use this in the future I have moved on to building the component in Vue.js because it is more compatible with Laravel 5.4
